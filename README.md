# Terminal Tetris
  Tetris is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. Wikipedia --[Tetris (Russian: Тетрис)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). This version of tetris is developed using boilerplate I created ([NodeJS-CLI-App-Boilerplate](Mugambi-Ian/NodeJS-CLI-App-Boilerplate---TypeScript))
